# WikiCLI

The WackWiki command-line interface should provide a way to easily create new elements in your wiki.
Ideas are fickle things and they should therefore be easy to capture.
When you have an idea then, you should be able to fire off a quick command and have the program take over - knowing exactly what to put where to enable you to do what you want.
