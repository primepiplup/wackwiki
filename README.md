# WackWiki

The goal of this project is to create an open wiki system that can be used in personal or professional settings.
The aim is to keep the format as open as possible, allowing tools to easily be written that can parse and link the different wiki files.
The wiki software should bend to the user's will, not constraining the expression of their ideas.
By providing a simple system it should be easy to write plugins for your favourite editors or small scripts to automate certain elements of wiki management.
